0. It is not specified how the function should behave when invalid input is
   provided
   >> add("X")
   Assuming ValueError. Since it is not given in the specification, I don't
   provide any testcases for this behavior

=== Task 1

1. It is specified that the function should accept 0 to 2 numbers, but it is
   not specified how should it bevahe if more numbers provided
   >> add("1,2,3")
   Assuming ValueError. Since it is not given in the specification, I don't
   provide any testcases for this behavior

=== Task 3

2. specification 3.2 says "there's no need to prove this", but to be sure I've
   added a testcase for incorrect input example

3. there's a contradiction in the specification 3.1: it says that newlines
   should be accepted __INSTEAD__ of commas, but at the same time it states
   that the input "1\n2,3" is OK. I am assuming that the newlines are
   acceptable __IN ADDITION TO__ commas

4. specification 3.3 is unclear. Should the given delimiter replace comma only
   or both comma and newline? Assuming the second.
